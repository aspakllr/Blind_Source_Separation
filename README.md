Code developed for my diploma thesis, titled "Implementation and evaluation of separation methods for multi-channel periodic biosignals" for the Electrical & Computer Engineering program, University of Patras.

Description: Application and comparison of different computational methods for the separation of periodic, acoustic
biosignals obtained from a multi-channel system of piezoelectric sensors during sleep. The methods that were examined are:
Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Periodic Component Analysis(Ï€CA). Two new techniques, 
based on the least squares method, were also implemented and applied to the signals.
