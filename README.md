Title: "Implementation and evaluation of separation methods for multi-channel periodic biosignals"

Description: Application and comparison of different computational methods for the separation of periodic, acoustic
biosignals obtained from a multi-channel system of piezoelectric sensors during sleep. The nethods that were examined were:
Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Periodic Component Analysis(Ï€CA). Also two
least squares methods were implemented and applied to the signals.
